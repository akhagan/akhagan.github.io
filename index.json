However, conversion from bacillus to spore is a complex, energetically costly process that requires many nutrients, including iron. _B. anthracis_ requires the siderophore petrobactin to scavenge iron from host environments. We show that, in the Sterne strain, petrobactin is required for efficient sporulation, even when ample iron is available. The petrobactin biosynthesis operon is expressed during sporulation, and petrobactin is biosynthesized during growth in high-iron sporulation medium, but instead of being exported, the petrobactin remains intracellular to protect against oxidative stress and improve sporulation. It is also required for full growth and sporulation in blood (bovine), an essential step for anthrax transmission between mammalian hosts.","tags":null,"title":"Petrobactin protects against oxidative stress and enhances sporulation efficiency in Bacillus anthracis Sterne","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ada K.

While we understand much about petrobactin biosynthesis and ferric petrobactin import, how apo-petrobactin (iron free) is exported remains unknown. This study used a combination of bioinformatics, genetics, and mass spectrometry to identify the petrobactin exporter. After screening 17 mutants with mutations of candidate exporter genes, we identified the apo-petrobactin exporter (termed ApeX) as a member of the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family of transporters. In the absence of ApeX, petrobactin accumulates inside the cell while continuing to export petrobactin components that are capable of transporting iron. Thus, the loss of ApeX does not affect the ability of _B. anthracis_ to cause disease in mice. This has implications for treatment strategies designed to target and control pathogenicity of _B. anthracis_ in humans.","tags":null,"title":"Petrobactin Is Exported from Bacillus anthracis by the RND-Type Exporter ApeX","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ada K.

While recent advances in our understanding of _B. anthracis_ iron acquisition systems indicate the use of strategies similar to other pathogens, this review focuses on unique features of the major siderophore system, petrobactin. Ways that petrobactin differs from other siderophores include: A. unique ferric iron binding moieties that allow petrobactin to evade host immune proteins; B. a biosynthetic operon that encodes enzymes from both major siderophore biosynthesis classes; C. redundancy in membrane transport systems for acquisition of Fe-petrobactin holo-complexes; and, D. regulation that appears to be controlled predominately by sensing the host-like environmental signals of temperature, CO2 levels and oxidative stress, as opposed to canonical sensing of intracellular iron levels. We argue that these differences contribute in meaningful ways to _B. anthracis_ pathogenesis.

Everyone had the right to vote and access to capitalism, which meant that hard work always led to success. If it didn’t, then you were doing something wrong. It wasn’t until my graduate career at the University of Michigan that I learned otherwise.\nIn 2014, I traveled to Ethiopia in my first international experience. There, I taught immunology and microbiology to medical students who had only recently learned English and who had different values, experiences, and assumptions than I did. Not only did I learn a lot about teaching and how to navigate interactions with other cultures, but I also learned the isolation that comes with being visibly different from your peers and how privileged I was just by virtue of my birth country. This experience led me to question my career goals and laid the foundation for what I would learn in the years to come, that a couple of laws don’t change the backbone of a country founded on inequity.\nThe scientific literature is finally catching up to the personal experiences of underrepresented minorities in academia, documenting that implicit biases, and systems designed to support white men, repeatedly fail nearly all other demographics. Potential inequities lay at nearly all steps from childhood through academic administration and limit the access of less privileged individuals to “successful” academic careers. This isn’t fair.\nReturning to the States, the first problem I noticed, was how scientists speak to each other. The language and syntax used in academia is highly exclusionary, so I co-founded a student group that focused on translating and communicating science for non-experts. One of our most successful ventures was live-blogging a campus academic conference to make it accessible to scientists unable to attend as well as non-scientists.\nMy passion for breaking down barriers in science, led to my postdoctoral fellowship in the journals department of the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). Here, I was given the opportunity to study the barriers and biases in the peer review process. Academic publishing is a cornerstone to academic careers and the decisions made by journal editors and reviewers have lasting impacts on careers. A literature review of the field left me angry at the seemingly endless documentations of bias. I was also mentally exhausted, but the experience has made me a stronger advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\nThroughout my graduate career, I supported and mentored several undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in academia, made efforts to make science more accessible, and participated in programs for underrepresented groups, such as the McNair Scholars Program. However, since beginning my postdoctoral fellowship, I have begun making more thoughtful and concerted efforts to improve fairness through DEI. I’ve suggested and helped brainstorm department-wide DEI discussions that led to action items adopted by my department at UM. I helped draw attention to and improve invited speaker diversity by compiling data on previous invited speakers and presenting my findings to the department faculty. I’ve also become active in the department DEI committee and the broader UM DEI community through completion of a professional development certificate focusing on DEI.\nThese efforts are small, and only a beginning, but they are the foundation of what I believe should be everyone’s life work - making life as fair as it can be.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"1a5d751ab8215cfbb64b41def8c32cf2","permalink":"https://akhagan.com/project/dei-statement/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dei-statement/","section":"project","summary":"My thoughts:\nGrowing up poor, there were few things my family could afford and any complaint about fairness received my father’s patented response: “Life isn’t fair.” I never dared to voice my internal reply of “But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be.","tags":["DEI"],"title":"Ada's Approach to DEIJ","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"a45ef324cd1603a592097524e727aebd","permalink":"https://akhagan.com/project/diversify-digest/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/diversify-digest/","section":"project","summary":"The goal for Diversify is to provide resources for scientists who are learning and growing in their anti-racism.

Exposure to and consumption of that water through October 2015—when the water source was switched back—has led to learning and developmental delays and correlates with decreased fertility. The water switch is now linked to deaths caused by the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila.\nLegionella are gram-negative bacteria found throughout nature, where they infect amoebae. However, they can also live in built environments, such as reservoirs and water towers, where they form persistent biofilms from which bacteria are dispersed. When the water is used, people are exposed to the bacteria by inhaling aerosolized water droplets like those produced by showers and sprinkler systems.\nOnce in the lungs, legionellae can cause the infection known as Legionnaires’ disease. The bacteria invade and replicate in lung macrophages, which provide a replication environment similar to that in their amoebae hosts. Unchecked, the infection leads to pneumonia and a 10-30% chance of death, primarily in those with compromised immune systems, including those over 50 and current or former smokers.\nAlthough at least 24 species of Legionella are associated with human disease, about 90% of Legionnaires’ cases are caused by Legionella pneumophila. This is the organism that University of Michigan professor and ASM President Elect Michele Swanson researches. Her work has focused on how legionellae replicate inside macrophages, evade degradation, and, more recently, persist in the environment.\nBoth Swanson’s expertise in legionellae and proximity to Flint meant she was ready and able to join a multidisciplinary team created to study the effects of changes in the Flint water source on public health. This research group, the Flint Area Community Health and Environment Partnership (FACHEP), also includes researchers from the Henry Ford Health System, Michigan State University, Colorado State University, the MADE Institute, Genesee Health Systems, and Kettering University. FACHEP was created in January 2016, when Michigan Governor Rick Snyder organized a $3.35-million contract with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and Wayne State University to fund the collaboration.\nBefore the Flint water crisis, there were 6 to 12 Legionnaires’ disease cases in a typical year in the Flint area. When Flint’s source water was switched to the Flint River, there were 45 cases per year in 2014 and 2015. Nick Lyons, the former director of MDHHS, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to respond to the Flint Legionnaires’ outbreak for more than a year, while the Chief Medical Executive, Dr. Eden Wells, has been charged with obstruction of justice. Wells has also been accused of interfering with research conducted by the FACHEP group. If the MDHHS can show that the outbreak was limited to patients and visitors to the McLaren hospital in Flint (which has been plagued by hospital-associated Legionnaires’ disease), then a guilty verdict might be avoided. However, FACHEP’s recently published research doesn’t support the hypothesis of the MDHHS, who despite providing funding for the FACHEP, disputes the findings from both papers. That funding will no longer be available following a contract dispute and was announced the day following publication of Zahran et. al in PNAS.\n  Figure 1. Chlorine levels before, during, and after the switch from Lake Huron to the Flint River (used with permission from source, figure 1b).  Zahran et. al, compared cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Flint and surrounding areas over a six-year period (before, during, and after the Flint water switch) to chlorine levels at multiple locations in the city, and found compelling correlations. Before the water source was switched to the Flint River, chlorine levels at all eight locations clustered together with levels ranging between 0.2 and 1 mg/L. However, after the switch to Flint River water, the chlorine levels went haywire and fluctuated wildly between locations, ranging from almost 0 to 2.5 mg/liter (Figure 1). Levels restabilized after the water source was switched back to Lake Huron.\n  Figure 2. The probability of Legionnaires’ disease as a function of chlorine levels. (used with permission from source, figure 3)  When the researchers plotted the probability of Legionnaires’ disease against Cl$_2$ levels they found that the chlorine concentration was predictive of disease occurrence. For chlorine to act as an effective disinfectant, it must be present as Cl$_2$ in levels of at least 0.2 mg/liter and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 0.5 mg/liter. The odds of a person in Flint contracting Legionnaires’ disease increased by nearly threefold when the average weekly …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"79000d4527fb254c0e65de135835cc86","permalink":"https://akhagan.com/post/examining-flint/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/examining-flint/","section":"post","summary":"Why did cases of Legionnaires’ disease spike when the water source was changed for Flint, Michigan?

Is your urine sterile? And do bacterial cells outnumber your own cells 10:1? These were some of the persistent microbial myths addressed in the video, “Microbial Myths.” Dr. Michael Schmidt and I began the discussion with some ASM history, after which Dr. Michael Schmidt explained the facts behind the 5-second rule and addressed other questions in depth. We followed this with a lightning round for short answers on some big questions, and the session wrapped with Dr. Schmidt on the spot as he accepted questions from the live audience at ASM Microbe 2018 in Atlanta, Ga.\n  The lightning round was fun but fast, and didn’t allow in-depth answers to a complex question, nor did we have time to address all of the questions from the audience. Let’s dive into the studies surrounding those questions here.\nYou can sanitize your sponge in the microwave. Verdict: MYTH Kitchen sponges are the perfect breeding ground for bacteria: they’re warm and moist after use; they’re covered in pores that trap water and provide surfaces for bacteria to replicate; they come in contact with contaminated surfaces (like moldy food dishes and chicken-laden cutting boards), and they’re used for weeks or months at a time. This perfect storm makes it no surprise that sponges harbor more bacteria than anywhere else tested in the average home.\nSeveral products and techniques claim to sanitize your kitchen sponges, so they can be “safely” reused. For instance, a Google search for “ways to sanitize a sponge” brought up websites suggested microwaving, vinegar, and bleach as some of the most prevalent DIY techniques to extend the lifespan of a sponge. But do these techniques work?\n  Figure 1. A) Microscopic image of bacteria fluorescing on a sponge (red) B) Surface of the sponge (blue) C) Overlay of fluorescent bacteria and sponge. D) 3-D rendering of bacteria (red) on the surface of a sponge (blue) (Scale bar = 10µm). Source.  While studying the types of bacteria commonly found on sponges, a 2017 study touched on this question. Using microscopy techniques, the researchers visualized bacteria growing inside the pores of 14 used kitchen sponges and found high bacterial counts (~10^7^ to 10^9^ cfus per sponge). DNA sequencing showed that about 36% of the bacteria on sponges belonged to the family Moraxellaceae, which is a common member of the skin microbiome. Other prevalent taxa were Pseudomonadaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcaceae. Some taxa, such as Xanthomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, varied according to the sponge tested, which might reflect the habits and food choices of the previous owners. Another study also found Bacillus and Micrococcus to be prevalent on kitchen sponges. Potentially pathogenic bacteria seem to comprise only a small portion of the bacteria found on a sponge.\nCan sanitizing your sponge eliminate these bacteria? In the 2017 study above, previous owners of some of the collected sponges reported to have “cleaned” their sponges regularly (either microwaving or rinsing with hot water). Despite cleaning, these sponges contained the same number of bacteria as non-sanitized sponges, but the makeup of the bacterial communities differed. Sponge sanitation clearly doesn’t kill all of the bacteria present on a sponge, and any surviving bacteria can quickly take over sponge real estate. This is due to the high numbers of bacteria that colonize the sponge surface: even if microwaving were to kill 99.9% of 10^7^ bacteria, almost 10,000 are still alive!\nInstead of sanitizing the sponge, microwaving or using other techniques may predispose a sponge to harboring heartier bacterial species. Your best bet is to rinse the sponge daily and replace it all together on a weekly basis or after wiping up raw egg or meat. If you’re concerned about the environmental impact of this suggestion, consider purchasing dye-free, biodegradable sponges or using dishrags that can be frequently washed and dried.\nDelaying baby’s first bath helps establish the skin microbiome. Verdict: Probably TRUE Newborn babies are covered with vernix caseosa, a thick Vaseline-like layer that protects their fragile skin from moisture in utero and contains antibacterial enzymes such as lysozyme. On top of this, the birthing process coats newborns in blood and other bodily fluids, which might be contaminated with blood borne pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis C. These fluids, along with the vernix, are wiped away following birth and the newborn is bathed as soon as possible, in part to protect hospital staff from blood borne pathogens. The World Health Organization suggests that baby’s first bath should be postponed for 24 hours to prevent hypothermia, but many U.S. hospitals bathe the infant around eight hours post-birth unless the parents request otherwise. The life-threatening issue of hypothermia has guided much of the research and recommendations for infant bathing thus far.

But is there a way to take what we’ve learned about these essential molecules and use them to turn the tide against the wave of antibacterial resistance? Researchers are developing sideromycins, inhibitors and vaccines to turn siderophores against their makers.\nSideromycins To get an edge in survival against competing bacterial species, some bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces spp.) make sideromycins, siderophores conjugated with an antibiotic molecule. Sideromycins look like siderophores to other species of bacteria, which import them for their iron payload. But by bringing sideromycins in, the bacteria inadvertently poison themselves with the attached antibiotic. Researchers have caught onto this trick and designed their own sideromycins to target bacterial pathogens. This is important work since antibacterial resistance is at an all-time high and the number of effective antibiotics is decreasing. Since most resistance mechanisms rely on keeping the antibiotics out, the Trojan Horse sideromycins might help antibiotics bypass these and target specific pathogens.\nThis is what researchers at the University of Notre Dame had in mind when they designed a sideromycin against the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The authors conjugated the antibiotic daptomycin to the A. baumannii siderophore called fimsbactin and effectively treated infected mice. This is especially exciting because daptomycin is traditionally only effective against gram-positive bacteria, but by conjugating it to fimsbactin, they could use it to treat the gram-negative A. baumannii, but not others (e.g., E. coli, Pseudomonas). Other groups have generated sideromycins against Staphylococcus aureus, Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and even A. baumannii, but this report is the first to show that the drugs can work in a mouse infection model. And unfortunately, it is possible for mechanisms to prevent sideromycin import to evolve, thus creating resistance against sideromycins.\nInhibitors Another way to co-opt our knowledge of siderophores is to generate new antibiotics that target siderophores and prevent their production or use by pathogens. There are two common pathways for siderophore biosynthesis in bacteria, and researchers have taken advantage of these similarities to identify small molecules that interact with and inhibit siderophore biosynthesis enzymes. In some cases, researchers use rational design to generate these small molecules. By taking what they know about the structure of the enzymes and how they function, researchers can generate small molecules that they think will act as inhibitors. Two 2005 studies described how researchers targeted an early step in siderophore biosynthesis by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One group designed molecules that interfered with a biosynthetic protein’s ability to bind ATP, while the other targeted the ligand binding site of a biosynthetic protein and was also able to inhibit siderophore biosynthesis by Yersinia pestis. More recently, Dr. David Sherman’s lab at the University of Michigan screened a library of naturally occurring small molecules for their ability to inhibit siderophore biosynthesis in Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus. In all of these cases, the identified molecules inhibited growth of the pathogen in a test tube, but none have been tested in a mouse model of infection.\nVaccines The best way to fight an infection is by preventing it from happening at all. With that in mind, Dr. Harry Mobley’s lab at the University of Michigan has been exploring siderophore-based vaccines against urinary tract infections. Initially, they tried to target the immune response against select siderophore receptors on the cell surface of urinary pathogenic E. coli (UPEC). With this method, they successfully vaccinated mice against the receptor for yersiniabactin and generate a protective immune response. But those proteins are unwieldy and difficult to purify for regular use in a vaccine. What about targeting the siderophore itself?\nGenerating protective vaccines that target siderophores has been considered a risky prospect since the molecules are so small and don’t seem to elicit immune responses. While a 2009 study demonstrated it was possible to generate antibodies against a siderophore (in this case vibriobactin), they didn’t show a protective immune response. But two papers published side-by-side in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last year showed how researchers have accomplished targeting the mouse immune response against siderophores. One study from the Mobley lab described their continued efforts to generate a vaccine against UPEC. Here, they conjugated the siderophores aerobactin and yersiniabactin to cationized bovine serum …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a77a3a6884edf7c4e5ef680e1e378cf0","permalink":"https://akhagan.com/post/siderophore-treatment-target/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/siderophore-treatment-target/","section":"post","summary":"Iron is essential for many bacterial pathogens to cause disease so they often use siderophores to gather it.

But siderophores can do double duty, with functions in survival, attack, and signalling, making these molecules bacterial Swiss Army knives.\nSurvival   Figure 1. Part of the periodic table highlighting some of the elements shown to be bound by siderophores. Those highlighted in green (Mn, Fe, Zn) are essential for growth and those in yellow (B, Si, Cu) are helpful for survival or signaling. Source.  [Fig]The affinity of siderophores for iron occurs along a spectrum from high to low, and where a siderophore falls on this spectrum can alter their potential to bind other elements. In the last siderophore post, we learned that siderophores can import essential nutrients other than iron like manganese or zinc. But siderophores can also bind non-essential nutrients, as occurs with the silicon-binding enterobactin found in the root system of a Cameroonian medicinal plant. This silicon-binding ability doesn’t seem to benefit the producing Streptomyces species, but likely acts as a cooperative molecule that provides the silicon its plant host requires.\nSome siderophores can also bind copper, not for growth, but for survival by decreasing toxic quantities to manageable ones. Copper is toxic to bacteria, capable of killing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus within 90 minutes (they can survive 72 hours on stainless steel). Copper binds to cellular proteins, altering their structure and thus their ability to function. And like iron, copper has redox potential so it can also undergo the Fenton reaction, taking or trading electrons between Cu^1+^ and Cu^2+^ to generate hydroxyl radicals (negatively charged oxygen species like OH- or OH˙ that damage DNA).\n  Figure 2. Enterobactin uses catechols (red) to bind iron and copper. Source.  Yersiniabactin is one siderophore that can bind copper, defending against both copper toxicity and reactive oxygen species. Enterobactin can also bind copper, but only after oxidation of the siderophore by the protein CueO. Enterobactin binds iron using three structural features called catechol rings (circled in Fig. 2). If these rings are left unoxidized in the non-iron-bound-siderophore they can reduce copper, which worsens toxicity. By oxidizing enterobactin, CueO both helps the siderophore bind toxic copper and prevents it from becoming more toxic.\nBoth copper and reactive oxygen species are encountered by infection-causing bacteria within macrophages, which use those methods to kill invaders. Two siderophores that use catechol rings to bind iron, salmochelin and enterobactin, can protect bacteria against the “oxidative burst”. The catch is that they must be inside the cell. The Staphylococcus siderophore staphyloferrin B also protects against reactive oxygen species, but siderophores that lack catechols, such as yersiniabactin and aerobactin, aren’t protective.\nSignaling Instead, yersiniabactin appears to act as a signaling molecule with the immune response. The siderophore has been shown to help Klebsiella pneumoniae infections spread and increase inflammation (which increases the production of reactive oxygen species). Other siderophores act as signals to cells of either the same or differing bacterial species. Researchers have also found boron-bound siderophores in seawater, where boron is quite common. Since bacteria don’t require boron and the boron-siderophore structure is different from iron-bound siderophore, the authors suggest that they function as signaling molecules instead of scavengers. Perhaps their signalling function is similar to pseudomonad pyoverdine, which helps to regulate its own production, as well as that of other proteins like toxins.\n  Figure 3. When E. coli and B. subtilis are grown on agar together (top left), B. subtilis begins sporulation indicated by the expression of fluorescent proteins (bottom left). However, culturing B. subtilis with B. circulans (top right), doesn’t induce sporulation (bottom right). Source, Fig. 1.  Some strains of bacteria belonging to the Firmicute phylum, such as Clostridia and Bacillus, form endospores. Endospores are like survival pods that enable the bacteria to survive harsh conditions. The process of endospore formation (sporulation) occurs in response to environmental signals, such as low nutrient levels. Recently, researchers have identified another one, siderophores. When Bacillus subtilis imports siderophores produced by other species (e.g., enterobactin from E. coli), this triggers sporulation. Sporulation frees up resources for E. coli but enables long-term survival for B. subtilis.\nStriking The poaching of siderophores by non-producing bacterial species (such as enterobactin import by B. subtilis) is common in the microbial world. But siderophores are not always what they appear to be—and bear more than metallic gifts.

Underrepresented groups face a complex set of barriers to achieving faculty status, including imposter syndrome, increased performance expectations, and patterns of exclusion. Institutionalized racism and sexism have contributed to these barriers and perpetuated policy that excludes underrepresented minorities. These barriers can contribute to decreased feelings of belonging, which may result in decreased retention of underrepresented minorities. Though some universities have altered their hiring practices to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the applicant pool, these changes have not been sufficient. Here we argue that departmental invited seminar series can be used to provide trainees with scientific role models and increase their sense of belonging while institutions work towards more inclusive policy. In this study, we investigated the demographics (gender and race) of invited seminar speakers over 5 years to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan. We also investigated current trainee demographics and compared them to invited speaker demographics to gauge if our trainees were being provided with representation of themselves. We found that invited speaker demographics were skewed towards Caucasian men, and our trainee demographics were not being represented. From these findings, we proposed policy change within the department to address how speakers are being invited with the goal of increasing speaker diversity to better reflect trainee diversity. To facilitate this process, we developed a set of suggestions and a web-based resource that allows scientists, committees, and moderators to identify members of underserved groups. These resources can be easily adapted by other fields or subfields to promote inclusion and diversity at seminar series, conferences, and colloquia.","tags":["DEI","Data Analysis"],"title":"Suggestions for Improving Invited Speaker Diversity To Reflect Trainee Diversity","type":"publication"}]
